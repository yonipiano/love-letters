Michal, I just wanted to tell you that not a moment goes by that I don’t think about you, and that every day I don’t see you feels like an eternity, or the longest day ever.<br><br>
I’m so glad that you’re enjoying yourself and having fun because you really deserve it, and I’m counting down the days until I see you again. 3 more days!!<br><br>
I’m trying to stay busy and do stuff, work or whatever, but it’s a little boring without your presence... everything reminds me of you — songs, places, sunsets, coffee. I think about you every second of the day, and I wonder what you’re doing and how much fun it would be if I was there with you on vacation, just me and you.<br>
And don’t worry, we will go soon soon, I promise. 😉<br><br>
I miss you like crazy, and I want to remind you that you are the most beautiful girl in the world — beautiful inside and out — and you are the only girl I have eyes for. I love every single thing about you.<br><br>
I love your laugh, your voice, your adorable smile, your cute little expressions you make when I say something stupid 😅. I love the way your hand fits in mine, and godd I miss your hugs 😩. You give the best hugs, and it’s a routine for me, so I go crazy if I don’t get them.<br><br>
I can’t wait to hold you again and tell you in person how much I love you. So for now, I’m sending you the biggest hug and a kiss from afar.<br><br>
But just know that every time I unlock my phone, I see you, and when I’m not on my phone, I still think about you.<br><br>
And if you ever feel a little far from home, just remember that there’s someone back home who is thinking about you every second and is smiling like an idiot because of how much he loves you.<br><br>
I love you so so so much, and I genuinely hope you get to enjoy yourself, and I’ll be waiting for you the second you come back home. ❤️<br><br>
Good night my love.<br>
Sleep well.
</p>
